- Accidentally deleted a bunch of commits, lost a lot of code
- Retrieved most from a backup
-- Added a Job Queue to deal with multiple single posts, and simultaneous different posts
- Need to re-add:
-- Change summary formatting:
--- Group and sort by player name, then game name
-- Add /scoreboard command
--- Displays everything in monospace `text` and shows game, player, turn, timestamp; sorted by game

- Created a new Startup routine
-- Polls the lst summary message, and the last 100 update posts and rebuilds the summary
- Rebuilt the message fetching routine to handle "things" better
- Standardized the console messages to better show program flow
- Added a "*" indicator in the summary to show the last game to be updated
-- Also shows "Server Rebooted" if the summary post is new because the server restarted
